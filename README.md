# Progressive radiosity tutorial with OpenGL

## What is this?
Radiosity is a global illumination algorithm - like ray tracing or path tracing but unlike the latter two it is hard (if not impossible) to find a modern tutorial for it. This repository houses the source code of the GPU-accelerated radiosity renderer I developed for my 3rd year project at King's College London, which forms the basis of the tutorials. It also contains a few test scenes and my dissertation that accompanied my code.

## When?
When it's done.<sup>TM</sup> In the meantime, if you are not scared of academic writing feel free to take a look at my dissertation since it was written with an eventual tutorial series in mind so it might be enough to get you started with radiosity. If you're curious the dissertation also has some images produced by the renderer so you can check what it is capable of. In the appendices section there is also a preliminary chapter from the tutorial which shows what the general structure of the series is going to be.

Overall, the tutorials are meant to be a more detailed and in-depth version of the implementation section, with code samples and possibly additional images. I plan to write the tutorials for an intermediate-to-advanced OpenGL audience so do brush up on the basics before starting the series!

## Code style
The code was not meant to be production-grade, it was written with readability and understandability in mind. It was also my first OpenGL/graphics programming project so do tell me if you see any blatant violations of common sense.
